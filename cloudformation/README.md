## Objective

This repository consists of a CloudFormation template and helper scripts.
The objective is to create and provision an AWS EC2 instance with a configured Python project, and optionally run commands against it.

More specifically, the CloudFormation template performs the following operations:
1. Launch a configurable EC2 instance (parameters include AMI, Instance type, Volume size, etc.)
2. Enable CloudWatch (CW) so that the EC2 instance can send logs in real time to the CW service - Very helpful to monitor the stack creation progress
3. Install a given version of Miniconda, Python, and Poetry to manage project dependencies
4. Clone a given repository and checkout to a given branch
5. Run a user defined script via the `files/ec2_run_script.sh`, eg (Activate environment, do x,y,z with the repo...)
6. Send the CW logs to the given S3 bucket for archival
7. Optionally delete the stack upon the `files/ec2_run_script.sh` completion

## AWS Prerequisites

In order to launch the stack, it is assumed that the following prerequisites are met.
1. Create an AWS account
2. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and run `aws configure`
3. Create a Parameter `github_ssh_private_key` in the AWS Parameter Store (System Manager) - The content of this parameter is the private SSH key to clone repositories.
4. Create an EC2 Key Pair to be able to SSH into the created instances
5. Create an S3 Bucket for storing files used during the stack creation

## Parameters

The following parameters, defined in `parameters.json`, are used by the CloudFormation template `cfn-template.yaml` to configure the stack deployment.

##Â Personal Notes

Things to keep in mind for further template development:
* Use CF intrinsic functions etc: !GetAtt, FindInMap, ImportValue, Join, Sub, Conditions
* Use Nested Stacks (only update/delete the parent template - child templates must be on S3?)
* or Cross Stack (multiple templates too) with Export/Import values to link templates. eg. network_cfn.yml to create VPC/etc and export VPC/Subnet IDs - look at the Outputs tab in the console
* In the console, use ChangeSets instead of Update Stack, to review changes
* use DeletionPolicy (eg. Retain for SGs / Snapshot for DBs)
* with conditions (eg. if tag: Env=prod for Prod instances: use TerminationProtection, if dev -> don't create this, etc.)
* Use DependsOn for DBs
* Deploy inline lambda function (< 5000 chars, no dependency) vs. deploy big lambda function via a .zip uploaded on S3, using the S3ObjectVersion (find Version ID from S3 object), so that replacing the zip file in S3 will allow an update of the cfn stack
* Custom resource with Lambda: eg inline `lambda-empty-s3.yml`, which is needed when non-empty buckets needs to be deleted by cfn
* Drift detection to check if stack resources were modified manually
* cfn-hup to update cfn-init stuff without recreating resource.
* It checks every X mins if the cfn-init has changed, if so, run the cfn-auto-reloader.conf
* Useful for eg. to use a different cloud_watch_config.jon file: When updating the stack with a different path value, cfn-hup will tell that the stack init metadata / ec2 state has changed and will update the instance without recreating it. Can check cfn metadata with /opt/aws/bin/cfn-get-metadata
* stack policies (.json) to prevent stack resources from updated with new template parameters (eg. deny update on security groups/DB)
