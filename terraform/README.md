Prerequisites:
- Install terraform
- terraform-docs: https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs

High level plan:
- make it functional (same stuff as cfn, git clone etc. take a note of what's left, eg. cw logs)
- use ansible for all the configuration stuff?
- clean up repo, pre-commit, makefile, cicd?
